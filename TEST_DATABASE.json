        "question": "What is the role of the Test Director (TD) in complex life support system tests?",
        "expected_answer": "As test complexity grows, the Test Director (TD) works alongside a dedicated Project Manager (PM). While the PM collects requirements, manages schedule and budget, and acts as liaison between requesting groups and the facility team, the TD focuses on hardware and software integration, engineer and technician leadership, test design buildup, and operations. The TD also acts as a 'gate keeper' to the test team, allowing the team to focus on tackling technological challenges.",

        "question": "What is the purpose of the pre-filter in the ISS air handling system?",
        "expected_answer": "Intakes for the air handling system on ISS have a 20 x 20 pre-filter Nomex mesh with opening size 841 Î¼m which prevents larger particles from entering the ISS filter element media. In the absence of gravitational settling, large particles can remain airborne but are easily entrained in the flow towards the filters. Regular vacuuming of the pre-filter is required to maintain system performance.",

        "question": "What was the initial aerosol source model used for ISS filtration design?",
        "expected_answer": "The initial aerosol source model for filtration design was based on reports quantifying rates for human-generated particles from literature and Shuttle cabin air filter analyses. This inventory included particles ranging from 1Î¼m to 1270 Î¼m, with binned size distribution information for coughs and sneezes. The model specified emission rates in terms of both aerosol number and mass generated per person, and quantified viable colony forming units of bacteria and fungi in these particles.",

        "expected_answer": "The quote \"The farther backward you can look the farther forward you can see\" summarizes the essence and purpose of Knowledge Capture. It emphasizes that KC makes it possible for scientists, engineers, and other members of the spacesuit community to look into the past, capture recorded past lessons learned, and use them to achieve more advanced technical designs for spacesuits.",

        "expected_answer": "Common criteria for selecting catalysts in a gasification system include: resistance to deactivation, minimal fouling, easy regeneration, high attrition resistance, low cost, and effective tar removal. Deactivation of a catalyst can be caused by coke formation, which is a major drawback. It's important to select a catalyst with low attrition to avoid coking and clogging of the system.",
