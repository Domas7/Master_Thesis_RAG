    "expected_answer": "The split of the 89-448 GHz frequency range into two telescopes (Medium Frequency Telescope and High Frequency Telescope) was motivated by a trade-off analysis between reflective versus refractive options. After studies conducted in the framework of the ESA CDF study and subsequent optimization, the fully refractive option was selected as the baseline for the MHFT. This design choice provides a very simple and compact design that takes advantage of strong heritage from ground-based and balloon-borne experiments such as BICEP2, Keck, SPIDER, LSPE, and Simons Observatory. Furthermore, the split between middle and high frequencies facilitates the design of the filtering scheme and the calibration strategy.",

The study analyzed a surface crack in a 3-inch-wide flat plate of 6061-T6 aluminum, using the SC 30 stress intensity factor solution for this configuration. In the first set of analyses, the plate was subjected to a remote tensile stress of 20 ksi with a stress ratio (R = Smin/Smax) of 0.1. The lives of the crack shown in the figures are the lives for each of the interpolated initial crack size aspect ratios up to the point when the crack transitions from a Part Through Crack (PTC) to a Through Crack (TC).",

In the first procedure, intermediate points on a straight line connecting the a and c values of the endpoints are read off as aj and cj, or alternatively, the linear equation for the line connecting the a, c endpoints may be used to compute intermediate points. The corresponding aspect ratio is computed as (aj/cj). In the second procedure, for obtaining round (a/c) numbers, simple algebra is used to transform the linear relationship of a and c into relationships between c and a/c and a and a/c. For any given value of (a/c)k, the values of ck can be calculated using the derived equation with the slope m and intercept r, and the corresponding value of ak can be calculated using a = (a/c)*c.",

The study compared mass-to-area ratios of b = 100 kg/m², b = 1000 kg/m², and no SRP, finding that for an increase in the mass-to-area ratio (i.e., less SRP effect), the bisection of the Laplace angle occurs at a smaller semi-major axis.

    "expected_answer": "The Kozai resonance occurs in a three-body system when the satellite has negligible mass compared to the other two bodies (asteroid and Sun), and the distance between the primary (asteroid) and the satellite is much closer than that of the primary to the Sun. It is caused by the orbit's argument of periapsis librating due to perturbations from the Sun. In this scenario, there is a conserved quantity: the angular momentum of the satellite's orbit in the Sun-asteroid orbit plane, expressed as Hz = √(1-e²)cos i. Therefore, as the inclination increases, the eccentricity will decrease and vice versa. The Kozai resonance most likely occurs further out from the asteroid where spherical harmonics don't significantly perturb the system. At certain high inclinations, the Kozai resonance can cause instability since the eccentricity will increase to the point of either collision with the asteroid or escape outside of the Hill sphere at apoapsis.",

The 32 output channel pattern was readily seen, but the dominant features in this image were from the electronics and out of range saturated pixel values. The dewar vacuum and cooling systems were also tested, with the test dewar reaching an intermediate vacuum of about 5.5 × 10^-4 mBar.",

The optics are held at a fixed distance and normal to the detector plane in a baffled and sealed U channel to minimize scattered light. The side port optics are designed to provide an image of one of the windowed ports of the vacuum chamber when a mirror is in place. With the U channel design, researchers can switch between uniform illumination (no optics), spot illumination, or side port imaging mode by simply switching out the top of the U channel.",

Fortunately, the flex hose had Kellum restraints that prevented damage to equipment and injury to personnel. The lesson learned was that identification and installation of fittings requires detailed attention. During the investigation, it was found that the appearance of the 1/2\" NPT female port was tapered, with a tapered/finished area on the port face very similar to an AN port face, making it easy to confuse.
