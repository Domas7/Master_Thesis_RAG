2025-03-27 13:06:31,635 - WARNING - Very short section 'Poor air quality (AQ) is a major and growing global public health concern [1]. It is estimated that the Global South is affected disproportionately by poor AQ, although this is difficult to verify empirically [2]. Ideally, AQ can be tracked by a national regu- latory reference-grade monitor (RGM) network [3]. Such networks are in place in sev- eral counties, many of which make their AQ data freely available to improve transpar- ency [4]. Many areas, however, including most African nations, have not yet estab- lished such networks (or not made their data publicly available), in part due to the high purchase and operation costs of RGM [5]. Low-cost AQ sensors (LCS) can help address this data gap, having already increased surface AQ monitoring density by up to an order' in RAG/NTRS_PDFS_CONFERENCE_GLOBAL/CMalings_ICAQAfrica2022_Proceedings.pdf with only 1 words
2025-03-27 13:06:31,635 - WARNING - Very short section 'resolution is 0.25° (approximately 25 kilometers) with high temporal frequency (every 15 minutes and hourly-average). The online FLUID system [17] allows air quality man- agers to easily visualize GEOS-CF outputs (see Fig. 2). A detailed overview and per- formance evaluation of GEOS-CF are provided by [15]. In Africa, GEOS-CF generally reproduces seasonal trends in Ozone, NO2, CO, and PM2.5 observed by RGM. However, GEOS-CF underestimated Ozone in Africa during April through September by about 5 ppbv, and underestimated afternoon Ozone peaks by about 10 ppbv. Surface SO2 is overestimated by GEOS-CF worldwide due to an outdated emission inventory. Nota- bly, lack of RGM limited GEOS-CF validation in Africa, e.g., only nine sites contrib- uted to PM2.5 validation. This emphasizes the need for more surface AQ data in Africa.' in RAG/NTRS_PDFS_CONFERENCE_GLOBAL/CMalings_ICAQAfrica2022_Proceedings.pdf with only 6 words

2025-03-27 13:24:57,765 - WARNING - Very short section 'Poor air quality (AQ) is a major and growing global public health concern [1]. It is estimated that the Global South is affected disproportionately by poor AQ, although this is difficult to verify empirically [2]. Ideally, AQ can be tracked by a national regu- latory reference-grade monitor (RGM) network [3]. Such networks are in place in sev- eral counties, many of which make their AQ data freely available to improve transpar- ency [4]. Many areas, however, including most African nations, have not yet estab- lished such networks (or not made their data publicly available), in part due to the high purchase and operation costs of RGM [5]. Low-cost AQ sensors (LCS) can help address this data gap, having already increased surface AQ monitoring density by up to an order' with only 1 words
2025-03-27 13:24:57,765 - WARNING - Very short section 'resolution is 0.25° (approximately 25 kilometers) with high temporal frequency (every 15 minutes and hourly-average). The online FLUID system [17] allows air quality man- agers to easily visualize GEOS-CF outputs (see Fig. 2). A detailed overview and per- formance evaluation of GEOS-CF are provided by [15]. In Africa, GEOS-CF generally reproduces seasonal trends in Ozone, NO2, CO, and PM2.5 observed by RGM. However, GEOS-CF underestimated Ozone in Africa during April through September by about 5 ppbv, and underestimated afternoon Ozone peaks by about 10 ppbv. Surface SO2 is overestimated by GEOS-CF worldwide due to an outdated emission inventory. Nota- bly, lack of RGM limited GEOS-CF validation in Africa, e.g., only nine sites contrib- uted to PM2.5 validation. This emphasizes the need for more surface AQ data in Africa.' with only 6 words

This should be noted because the WSR does not have any combinatorial logic. This suggests that the DFF nodes will be the dominant mechanisms of failures. Additional testing is required.  All LSRAM SEUs were single bit with exception to SEFIs. This suggests that they will be correctable when implementing error correction (SECDED). SEFIs were due to the current drops; and have been verified by duration of SEFI responses during beam exposure. In all SEFI cases, LSRAM cells could be restored by an overwrite. However, SECDED would not be able to be applied (SEFIs are not single bit errors).' with only 1 words

A USS (1) acts as a communications bridge between federated UTM actors to support Operators’ abilities to meet the regulatory and operational requirements for UAS operations, and (2) provides the Operator with demand forecasts for a volume of airspace so that the Operator can ascertain the ability to efficiently conduct their mission, and (3) archives operations data in historical databases for analytics, regulatory, and Operator accountability purposes. In general, these key functions allow for a network of USSs to provide cooperative management of low altitude operations without direct FAA involvement. USS services support operations planning, aircraft de-confliction, conformance monitoring, and emergency information' with only 1 words

2025-03-27 17:06:25,506 - WARNING - Very short section 'Achieving NASA’s aggressive fuel burn and emission reduction for N+3 aircraft will require hybrid electric propulsion system in which electric motors driven by either power generated from turbine or energy storage system will power the fan for propulsion. Motors designed for hybrid electric aircraft are expected to operate at medium to high voltages over long durations in a high altitude service environment. Such conditions have driven research toward the development of wire insulation with improved mechanical strength, thermal stability and increased breakdown voltage. The silicone class of materials has been considered for electric wire insulation due to its inherent thermal stability, dielectric strength and mechanical integrity. This paper evaluates the dependence of these properties on the cure conditions of a polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) elastomer; where both cure temperature and base-to-catalyst ratio were varied. The PDMS elastomer was evaluated as a bulk material and an impregnation matrix within a lightweight glass veil support. The E-glass support was selected for mechanical stiffness and dielectric strength. This work has shown a correlation between cure conditions and material physical properties. Tensile strength increased with cure temperature whereas breakdown voltage tended to be independent of process variations. The results will be used to direct material formulation based on specific insulation requirements.' with only 8 words

2025-03-27 17:06:25,506 - WARNING - Very short section 'Summary While marginal changes to thermal stability were noted as a function of these processing variables, the greatest benefit to the PDMS performance was incorporation of a glass veil support. The strong interface between two materials generated a 10 fold improvement in tensile strength and modulus. The influence of the glass veil was most notable at the 10:1.5 base/catalyst ratio due to bonding between the materials. An increase in dielectric breakdown voltage was noted in the composite structure, however due to variation in sample thickness, further work is required to elucidate the influence of the glass veil.' with only 1 words

The initial funding was from non-mission sources which allowed the engineers to participate uninhibited by near-term mission schedules. The diversity of the heritage missions (single string vs. redundant string, varying orbits, different operational communication scenarios, etc.) provided valuable insights into what drove FSW commonality and variability across different missions. The team took the entire FSW life-cycle into consideration, including in-orbit FSW sustaining engineering, as they performed their analysis. Identifying system and application level variation points to address the range and scope of the flight systems domain. The goal was to enable portability across embedded computing platforms and to implement different end-user functional needs without the need to modify the source code.  The cFS uses compile-time configuration parameters to implement the variation points. Figure 1 shows the results using a classic software engineering “V-model”. The shaded components are cFS artifacts and the <p> notation indicates a parameterized artifact. This lifecycle product line' with only 6 words

The APIs in Layers 1 and 2 have been instrumental in the cFS’ success across multiple platforms and the cFE API has remained unchanged since the launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009.

2025-03-27 18:33:28,599 - WARNING - Very short section 'The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) is an exciting international collaboration for a scientific mission that dramatically brings together the unique talents of the partners to expand observation space by simultaneously adding polarization measurements to the array of source properties currently measured (energy, time, and location). IXPE uniquely brings to the table polarimetric imaging. IXPE will thus open new dimensions for understanding how X-ray emission is produced in astrophysical objects, especially systems under extreme physical conditions—such as neutron stars and black holes. Polarization singularly probes physical anisotropies—ordered magnetic fields, aspheric matter distributions, or general relativistic coupling to black-hole spin—that are not otherwise measurable. Hence, IXPE complements all other investigations in high-energy astrophysics by adding important and relatively unexplored information to the parameter space for studying cosmic X- ray sources and processes, as well as for using extreme astrophysical environments as laboratories for fundamental physics.' with only 5 words

2025-03-27 18:36:39,651 - WARNING - Very short section 'Incheon International Airport (ICN) is one of the hub airports in East Asia. Airport operations at ICN have been growing more than 5% per year in the past five years. According to the current airport expansion plan, a new passenger terminal will be added and the current cargo ramp will be expanded in 2018. This expansion project will bring 77 new stands without adding a new runway to the airport. Due to such continuous growth in airport operations and future expansion of the ramps, it will be highly likely that airport surface traffic will experience more congestion, and therefore, suffer from efficiency degradation. There is a growing awareness in aviation research community of need for strategic and tactical surface scheduling capabilities for efficient airport surface operations. Specific to ICN airport operations, a need for A-CDM (Airport - Collaborative Decision Making) or S-CDM(Surface - Collaborative Decision Making), and controller decision support tools for efficient air traffic management has arisen since several years ago. In the United States, there has been independent research efforts made by academia, industry, and government research organizations to enhance efficiency and predictability of surface operations at busy airports. Among these research activities, the Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) developed and tested by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is a decision support tool to provide tactical advisories to the controllers for efficient surface operations. The effectiveness of SARDA concept, was successfully verified through the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations for both spot release and runway operations advisories for ATC Tower controllers of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) in 2010 and 2012, and gate pushback advisories for the ramp controller of Charlotte/Douglas International Airport (CLT) in 2014. The SARDA concept for tactical surface scheduling is further enhanced and is being integrated into NASA’s Airspace Technology Demonstration – 2 (ATD-2) project for technology demonstration of Integrated Arrival/Departure/Surface (ADS) operations at CLT. This study is a part of the international research collaboration between KAIA (Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement)/KARI (Korea Aerospace Research Institute) and NASA, which is being conducted to validate the effectiveness of SARDA concept as a controller decision support tool for departure and surface management of ICN. This paper presents the preliminary results of the collaboration effort. It includes investigation of the operational environment of ICN, data analysis for identification of the operational characteristics of the airport, construction and verification of airport simulation model using Surface Operations Simulator and Scheduler (SOSS), NASA’s fast-time simulation tool.' with only 1 words

2025-03-27 21:28:04,278 - WARNING - Very short section 'Due to operational constraints and the amount of tether reeling required for a Nadir pointing tether, the more complex Zenith design with a plasma contactor or electron emitter on the end mass was chosen as the baseline approach. The Zenith design also affords a better opportunity for other options. Since power availability from ISS is limited to 6 kW peak and with a very restricted duty cycle, the possibility of a self-sufficient ED Tether was investigated. A design with a micro-satellite type structure as the end mass with large solar arrays is a possible concept. The solar array would provide power for the ED Tether propulsion as well as avionics, reaction wheels, thrusters, etc. within the MicroSat. Using high efficiency solar cells for a small array size and when combined with the distance from ISS (E.g. 7 km) the issue of shadowing ISS solar arrays is minimized. The 7-kin distance of the avionics and power converter from ISS also helps with other ISS design drivers such as EMI and arcing. Power for the seldom used reel and tether cutter, which is still attached to ISS, would still be from ISS. This design is indicated' with only 3 words

Data were generated that compared all months (examples are in Figures 10-14). The ISS engine thrust was lower for these cases compared to the current value (same for both missions), so comparing ISS to exploration results may lead to false conclusions. But they do show the monthly trends. For all the parameters that correlate with launch month, the worst months are February, July, or August.' with only 1 words

This make it possible for Simulink blocks that are complied by Simulink Real-time Workshop to be imported as a Labview routine. The control signals from the Labview embedded controller software are converted to 2.5kHz pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal in Labview to drive the EVP valves. As a result, a command from 0 to 1 corresponds to PWM from 0 to 100%. The air begins to flow at approximately 30% PWM signal, and the valve is hilly open at 100% PWM signal. 32 Ignoring the PWM block and assuming that the 0-1 signal is proportional to the air jet flow (liters/minute), the actuator can be characterized as shown in Figure 2 where ui(i = 1, 2, 3) is the dimensionless control signal to the Labview PWM routine driving each valve.

Due to the presence of vehicle control system filters and the thrust oscillation suppression system, which are tuned to the structural characteristics of the vehicle, ARTEMIS must incorporate accurate structural models of the Ares I launch vehicle. The ARTEMIS core dynamics simulation models the highly coupled nature of the vehicle flexible body dynamics, propellant slosh, and vehicle nozzle inertia effects combined with mass and flexible body properties that vary significantly with time during the flight. All forces that act on the vehicle during flight must be simulated, including deflected engine thrust force, spatially distributed aerodynamic forces, gravity, and reaction control jet thrust forces. These forces are used to excite an integrated flexible vehicle, slosh, and nozzle dynamics model for the vehicle stack that simulates large rigid body translations and rotations along with small elastic deformations. Highly effective matrix math operations on a distributed, threaded high-performance simulation node allow ARTEMIS to retain up to 30 modes of flex for real-time simulation. Stage elements that separate from the stack during flight are propagated as independent rigid six degrees of freedom (6DOF) bodies. This paper will present the formulation of the resulting equations of motion, solutions to example problems, and describe the resulting dynamics simulation engine within ARTEMIS.' with only 1 words

From the data provided, the ∆ V required was 163 m/s with a T/W of >0.025. The initial mass of the spacecraft continued to be in flux due to changes to other spacecraft subsys- tems, therefore analysis was performed at several different masses in order to determine the appro- priate propulsion system to use. For each propulsion system analyzed, data were obtained from the spacecraft engine vendor (either aerojet or ATK) and used in the analysis.

Given the science requirements and conceptual designs for the science instruments, ACo completed the mis- sion analysis and created a conceptual spacecraft design that will meet the science goals. The result- ing spacecraft meets all launch, mission, thermal, communication, end-of-life, pointing, slewing, structural, and power requirements. of primary concern were the thermal and pointing/slewing requirements. The compact spacecraft volume coupled with the large thermal loads from the sci- ence instruments and spacecraft subsystems was an area of concern for thermal control, but ACo analysis shows that the thermal requirements are met with the proposed spacecraft design. In addi- tion, while previous spacecraft concepts that used reaction wheels could not meet the rapid slewing and repointing requirement for Xenia, the current design incorporates control moment gyros. This approach uses less power for slewing and can also rotate the spacecraft much more quickly, allow- ing the spacecraft to meet the rapid slewing requirement.' with only 3 words
