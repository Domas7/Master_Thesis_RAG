The test works by pressurizing the MPS propellant systems with helium and sampling the aft fuselage atmosphere using the Hazardous Gas Detection System (HGDS). Any helium leaking from the MPS would mix with the air in the aft fuselage and be detected as an increase in helium concentration. By measuring this change and knowing the air purge flow rate, a total system leak rate can be calculated.

As the fourth generation of CMB space missions, LiteBIRD is specifically targeting the measurement of the CMB B-mode signals, which are the best probe of primordial gravitational waves generated during the first period of our Universe's history, as predicted by the cosmological inflation theory. The detection of these B-modes would allow scientists to test major inflationary models and directly access the energy of inflation.",

        "expected_answer": "The technical requirements of the Medium and High Frequency Telescope (MHFT) are derived from the scientific high-level requirements on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, with a total uncertainty δr < 0.001. This total error budget is distributed equally over three main contributions at a level of 5.7 × 10^-4 each: statistical uncertainty, systematic uncertainty, and margin. The statistical uncertainty requirement is strongly driven by the global sensitivity of the instrument and implies stringent constraints on the 1/f noise component and mitigation of foreground contaminants. The systematics uncertainty budget is driven by the level of knowledge of the instruments, with the goal to keep the uncertainty on r smaller than 5.7 × 10^-6 for each source of instrumental systematic.",

        "expected_answer": "The LiteBIRD mission included a continuously-rotating half-wave plate (HWP) as the first optical element for all telescopes to effectively suppress 1/f noise. The presence of this continuously-rotating HWP allows the instrument to distinguish between the instrumental polarized signal and the sky signal, which is modulated at 4fHWP. A detailed trade-off analysis, including the polarization effects induced by the HWP itself, showed that performance would be degraded by a factor of about 2 without the HWP, with degradation scaling as the ratio of fknee over the spin rate of the satellite. Both the Medium Frequency Telescope (MFT) and High Frequency Telescope (HFT) are equipped with a levitating continuously-rotating HWP to minimize the heat load impact.",

        "expected_answer": "The split of the 89-448 GHz frequency range into two telescopes (Medium Frequency Telescope and High Frequency Telescope) was motivated by a trade-off analysis between reflective versus refractive options. After studies conducted in the framework of the ESA CDF study and subsequent optimization, the fully refractive option was selected as the baseline for the MHFT. This design choice provides a very simple and compact design that takes advantage of strong heritage from ground-based and balloon-borne experiments such as BICEP2, Keck, SPIDER, LSPE, and Simons Observatory. Furthermore, the split between middle and high frequencies facilitates the design of the filtering scheme and the calibration strategy.",

The study analyzed a surface crack in a 3-inch-wide flat plate of 6061-T6 aluminum, using the SC 30 stress intensity factor solution for this configuration. In the first set of analyses, the plate was subjected to a remote tensile stress of 20 ksi with a stress ratio (R = Smin/Smax) of 0.1. The lives of the crack shown in the figures are the lives for each of the interpolated initial crack size aspect ratios up to the point when the crack transitions from a Part Through Crack (PTC) to a Through Crack (TC).",

In the first procedure, intermediate points on a straight line connecting the a and c values of the endpoints are read off as aj and cj, or alternatively, the linear equation for the line connecting the a, c endpoints may be used to compute intermediate points. The corresponding aspect ratio is computed as (aj/cj). In the second procedure, for obtaining round (a/c) numbers, simple algebra is used to transform the linear relationship of a and c into relationships between c and a/c and a and a/c. For any given value of (a/c)k, the values of ck can be calculated using the derived equation with the slope m and intercept r, and the corresponding value of ak can be calculated using a = (a/c)*c.",

Four different remote loadings were analyzed: (A) St=20 ksi tensile loading, (B) St=15 ksi tensile plus Sb=5 ksi bending loadings, (C) St=10 ksi tensile plus Sb=10 ksi bending loadings, and (D) St=0 tensile with Sb=20 ksi bending loading. These stress loadings were selected to have the same maximum stress acting on the outer surface and the crack c-tip. As expected, the pure tensile loading had a lower life for most aspect ratio crack configurations compared to combined tensile and bending loadings.",

This equilibrium can be put in terms of the obliquity and Laplace angle, such that the Laplace angle can explicitly be solved: ω² sin 2φ + ωs sin 2(φ - ε) = 0. The Laplace angle φ is an azimuthal angle measured from the body's spin axis that defines the orbit to lie in-between the equator and the orbital plane such that as a goes to 0, φ goes to 0 and when a goes to ∞, φ goes to ε.",

With the inclusion of SRP perturbation terms, the modified Laplace equilibrium equation becomes: ω² sin 2φ + ωs sin 2(φ - ε) + 2ωsrp sin(φ - ε) = 0. The study compared mass-to-area ratios of b = 100 kg/m², b = 1000 kg/m², and no SRP, finding that for an increase in the mass-to-area ratio (i.e., less SRP effect), the bisection of the Laplace angle occurs at a smaller semi-major axis. For reference, a natural satellite with a mass-to-area ratio of 100 kg/m² and 1000 kg/m² is 0.075 m and 0.75 m respectively.",

        "expected_answer": "The Kozai resonance occurs in a three-body system when the satellite has negligible mass compared to the other two bodies (asteroid and Sun), and the distance between the primary (asteroid) and the satellite is much closer than that of the primary to the Sun. It is caused by the orbit's argument of periapsis librating due to perturbations from the Sun. In this scenario, there is a conserved quantity: the angular momentum of the satellite's orbit in the Sun-asteroid orbit plane, expressed as Hz = √(1-e²)cos i. Therefore, as the inclination increases, the eccentricity will decrease and vice versa. The Kozai resonance most likely occurs further out from the asteroid where spherical harmonics don't significantly perturb the system. At certain high inclinations, the Kozai resonance can cause instability since the eccentricity will increase to the point of either collision with the asteroid or escape outside of the Hill sphere at apoapsis.",
