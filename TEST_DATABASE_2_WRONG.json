      "expected_answer": "The Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) are a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions around the Arctic. They occur when charged particles from the sun enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with gas particles, causing them to emit light. The different colors are produced by different types of gas particles: oxygen produces green and red light, while nitrogen produces blue and purple. The displays can take many forms, including arcs, rays, spirals, and curtains.",

      "expected_answer": "The process of traditional glass blowing begins with gathering molten glass from a furnace on the end of a blowpipe. The glassblower then inflates the glass by blowing through the pipe while rotating it to maintain symmetry. Tools such as blocks, jacks, and shears are used to shape the glass. The piece is repeatedly reheated in a glory hole to keep it malleable during shaping. Once complete, the piece is transferred to a punty rod, broken off the blowpipe, and placed in an annealing oven to cool slowly, preventing thermal stress.",

      "expected_answer": "The process of traditional blacksmithing involves heating metal (typically iron or steel) in a forge until it becomes malleable, then shaping it by hammering it on an anvil. The smith uses various techniques such as drawing out (lengthening), upsetting (thickening), punching holes, and forge welding (joining pieces by heating and hammering them together). Tools include hammers, tongs, chisels, and hardy tools that fit into the anvil. Traditional blacksmiths create both functional items like tools and decorative pieces like gates and railings.",

      "expected_answer": "The process of traditional pottery firing in a wood kiln involves loading ceramic pieces into a brick chamber and gradually increasing the temperature by burning wood. The firing can last from 24 hours to several days, with temperatures reaching 1200-1300°C. Wood ash naturally creates a glaze on the pottery as it melts and lands on the pieces. The reduction and oxidation atmosphere inside the kiln, controlled by adjusting air flow, creates unique effects and colors that cannot be replicated in electric or gas kilns.",

      "expected_answer": "The process of traditional cheese making begins with acidifying milk, either through adding bacterial cultures or an acid like vinegar or lemon juice. Rennet is then added to coagulate the milk, forming curds and whey. The curds are cut, stirred, and often heated to release more whey. They are then placed in molds, pressed to remove additional whey, and salted either directly or by immersion in brine. The cheese is aged in controlled conditions, during which time it develops its characteristic flavor, texture, and aroma.",

The host prepares the tea room, arranges flowers, and selects appropriate utensils based on the season and occasion. Guests purify themselves at a stone basin before entering through a small door, symbolizing equality. The ceremony includes cleaning the utensils, preparing the tea by whisking matcha powder with hot water in a bowl, and serving it with traditional sweets. The practice emphasizes harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility.",

The hides are then soaked in a tanning solution, traditionally using vegetable tannins extracted from tree bark or chromium salts in modern methods. This process converts the protein structure of the skin, making it more durable and resistant to decomposition. After tanning, the leather is dried, softened through mechanical working, and often dyed or treated with oils and waxes to enhance its properties and appearance.",

It covers approximately 344,400 square kilometers and includes about 3,000 coral reefs, 600 continental islands, and 300 coral cays. The park is managed through a zoning system that regulates activities such as fishing, shipping, and tourism to minimize environmental impact. Despite protection efforts, the reef faces threats from climate change, coral bleaching, agricultural runoff, and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks.",

      "expected_answer": "The process of traditional perfume making involves extracting scents from natural materials using techniques such as steam distillation, solvent extraction, enfleurage, or expression. These extracts, called essential oils or absolutes, are then diluted with alcohol and aged. A finished perfume typically contains top notes (the initial, volatile scents), middle or heart notes (the main body of the fragrance), and base notes (long-lasting scents that ground the composition). The concentration of aromatic compounds determines whether the product is classified as perfume, eau de parfum, eau de toilette, or cologne.",
